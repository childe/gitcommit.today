File modes
The setuid and setgid bits are normally represented as the values 4 for setuid and 2 for setgid in the high-order octal digit of the file mode. For example, 6711 has both the setuid and setgid bits (4 + 2 = 6) set, and also the file read/write/executable for the owner (7), and executable by the group (first 1) and others (second 1). Most implementations have a symbolic representation of these bits; in the previous example, this could be u=rwx,go=x,ug+s.

Typically, chmod does not have a recursive mode restricted to directories, so modifying an existing directory tree must be done manually, with a command such as find /path/to/directory -type d -exec chmod g+s '{}' '\'.

Effects
The setuid and setgid flags have different effects, depending on whether they are applied to a file, to a directory or binary executable or non binary executable file. The setuid and setgid flags have an effect only on binary executable files and not on scripts (e.g., Bash, Perl, Python).[3]

When set on an executable file
When the setuid or setgid attributes are set on an executable file, then any users able to execute the file will automatically execute the file with the privileges of the file's owner (commonly root) and/or the file's group, depending upon the flags set.[2] This allows the system designer to permit trusted programs to be run which a user would otherwise not be allowed to execute. These may not always be obvious. For example, the ping command may need access to networking privileges that a normal user cannot access; therefore it may be given the setuid flag to ensure that a user who needs to ping another system can do so, even if their own account does not have the required privilege for sending packets.
