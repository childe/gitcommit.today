For tracing observability, the kernel provides a way to describe the type of each I/O using a character string named rwbs. This is defined in the kernel blk_fill_rwbs() function, and uses the characters:

- R: Read
- W: Write
- M: Metadata
- S: Synchronous
- A: Read-ahead
- F: Flush or Force Unit Access â€¢ D: Discard
- E: Erase
