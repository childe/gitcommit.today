[Chapter 13  Out Of Memory Management](https://www.kernel.org/doc/gorman/html/understand/understand016.html)

> 13.4  Killing the Selected Process

> Once a task is selected, the list is walked again and each process that shares the same mm_struct as the selected process (i.e. they are threads) is sent a signal. If the process has CAP_SYS_RAWIO capabilities, a SIGTERM is sent to give the process a chance of exiting cleanly, otherwise a SIGKILL is sent.


CAP_SYS_RAWIO 参考 [capabilities(7) — Linux manual page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html)
