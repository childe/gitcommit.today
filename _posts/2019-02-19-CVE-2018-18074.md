[https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/commit/c45d7c49ea75133e52ab22a8e9e13173938e36ff](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/commit/c45d7c49ea75133e52ab22a8e9e13173938e36ff)

	The Requests package before 2.20.0 for Python sends an HTTP Authorization header
	to an http URI upon receiving a same-hostname https-to-http redirect, 
	which makes it easier for remote attackers to discover credentials by sniffing the network.

原来这么严格. 同一个hostname, 从https转到http都不要带密码.
